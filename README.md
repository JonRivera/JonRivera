## Greetings

My name is Jonatan, and I am Data Scientist. I enjoy working on challenging projects that expand my current knowledge base in machine learning, data analysis, and data engineering. 

I  am presently working for start company Sol Analytica. During my 10 months with Sol Analaytica I have done the following:
-Worked on data warehouse engineering tasks such as developing  ETL,ELTs and systems for  Data Integration and Data Analytics using Snowflake, Tableau and AWS Lambda Functions and S3 lambda service. 

I have also Build, develop, implement, and maintain data systems for Tableau and analytics, with a focus on understanding our clients business needs, gathering business requirements and and creating  key performance indicators to help our clients improved there business.

Needless to say, building stuff is fun and exciting but I also develop custom tools and dashboards for our ELTS, real time data processes, ensuring continuous data integrity. I've done this using  python, aws lambda Applications, s3 services, and aws cloud watch, and tableau. 

Througout this 10 month journey, I also picked up new skills and also workon deploying and building webites using nginx. 

Lastly, I've work on custom projects for our cients, even working on development fronend and backend of  an online web analytical tool, using elastic beanstalk, pytho library Dash, and the scikit learn library.
