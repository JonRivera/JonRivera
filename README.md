## Greetings

My name is Jonatan, and I am Data Engineer with a Data Science background. I enjoy working on challenging projects that expand my current knowledge base in machine learning, data analysis, and data engineering. 

I am presently working for start up company Sol Analytica. During my 10 months with Sol Analytica I have done the following: -Worked on data warehouse engineering tasks such as developing ETL, ELTs and systems for Data Integration and Data Analytics using Snowflake, Tableau and AWS Lambda Functions and S3 lambda service.

I have also built, developed, implemented, and maintain data systems for Tableau and analytics, with a focus on understanding our client's business needs, gathering business requirements and creating key performance indicators to help our clients improve there business.

Needless to say, building stuff is fun and exciting but I also develop custom tools and dashboards for our ELTS, real-time data processes, ensuring continuous data integrity. I've done this using python, AWS lambda Applications, s3 services, and aws cloud watch, and tableau.

Throughout this 10 month journey, I have also picked up new skills and also work on deploying and building websites using nginx.

Lastly, I've worked on custom projects for our clients, even working on the development frontend and backend of an online web analytical tool, using elastic beanstalk, python library Dash, and the sci-kit learn library.

On top of all that, I manage day-to-day tasks from the development of ETL jobs, infrastructure design and management, internal pipeline development, and operational maintenance and monitoring.
